# Photon Energy Calculator

wave = int(input("What is the value of the wave length?")) # asks user for the wave length value

eV = 1.24 / wave # Photon energy equation at a particular wavelength expressed in electronic volts

f"The photon energy at the particular wavelength is {eV} electronic volts" # print out the value of the photon energy
